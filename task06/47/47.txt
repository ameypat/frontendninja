	Question: How do I center block-elements with CSS1? 

	Answer  : 

		  There are three ways of centering a block: 
	            	1.Centering with margins 

				body {
					  text-align: center;
 					   min-width: 500px;
				     }

				<div class="body">block area</div>
				<span class="body">block area</span>



			2.Centering with percentages 

				.body {
					  position: absolute;
					  width: 60%;
					  height: 30%;
					  left: 20%;
					  top: 35%;
				      }

				<div class="body">block area</div>
				<span class="body">block area</span>


			3.Centering with absolute sizes. 
	
				.body 
				 {
  					position: absolute;
					width: 280px;
					height: 350px;
					left: 50%;
					top: 50%;
 					margin-left: -140px;
					margin-top: -175px;
				 }

				<div class="body">block area</div>
				<span class="body">block area</span>


	Question: What is deference between cell padding and cell spacing?
	
	Answer  : CELLSPACING is the pixel width between the individual data cells in the TABLE. 
		  (The thickness of the lines makeing the TABLE grid). The default is zero.
		  If the BORDER is set at 0, the CELLSPACING lines will be invisible. 

		  <table border="1" cellspacing="5">
			  <tr>
			     <td>First Block</td>
			     <td>Second Block</td>
			  </tr><tr>
			     <td>Third Block</td>
			     <td>Forth Block</td>
			  </tr>
		 </table> 	

		CELLPADDING is the pixel space between the cell contents and the cell border. The default for this property is also zero. 
		This feature is not used often, but sometimes comes in handy when you have your borders turned on and you want the contents
		to be "away" from the border a bit for easy viewing. CELLPADDING is invisible, even with the BORDER property turned on

		<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
			<tr>
			   <td>First Block</td>
			   <td>Second Block</td>
			</tr><tr>
			   <td>Third Block</td>
			   <td>Forth Block</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
